{"name":"Swarm","tagline":"Crowd-sourced pest detection","body":"# About Swarm\r\nWhen it comes to identifying pest threats, early detection makes all the difference. Currently there is no reliable system to provide growers and Pest Control Advisors with advance warning of a nearby outbreak. Swarm introduces a new approach to pest management, offering real-time data about nearby sightings through a crowdsourced reporting app.\r\n\r\n![Swarm screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UdttzW0.png)\r\n\r\nUsers receive a series of photos of pests reported by others in the area, tapping \"yes\" or \"no\" to report whether they've seen these threats on their own fields. In return, the app displays valuable information about regional pest activity while preserving each farmer’s anonymity. Having that knowledge can be worth a lot. Swarm creates awareness where none exists, saving money in broad-spectrum pesticide applications through early detection and remediation. The app runs on Android and can be used in the field without active mobile phone coverage. Multiple search radii offer options to understand how close a threat may be to your field. Beneficial insect and stolen property reporting is supported. The app is easy to use across languages and guarantees the anonymity of each contributor. Swarm offers a completely new way of understanding what’s happening around your field.\r\n\r\n# Team\r\n* Joy Cowden\r\n* Eduardo Garcia\r\n* Nevena Golubovic\r\n* Kyle Jorgensen\r\n* Michelle Sisson\r\n* Robert Sisson\r\n\r\nThis project was created at the [Apps for Ag](http://www.apps-for-ag.com/) hackathon in Coalinga, CA.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
